Make simple HTTP requests with Racket

Sometimes you just want to shoot off some requests to a server and sorting through 
[http-client](https://docs.racket-lang.org/net/http-client.html) and [net/url](https://docs.racket-lang.org/net/url.html) is a bit much.

Heavily inspired by [racket-request](https://github.com/jackfirth/racket-request)
